# Core Objectives for Kubernetes Deployments

This project follows these core objectives for production-grade Kubernetes deployments:

1. **Resource Management**
   - Define CPU and memory requests/limits for all containers.

2. **Health Checks**
   - Implement liveness and readiness probes for all application containers.

3. **Secrets and Config Management**
   - Use Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps for sensitive and environment-specific configuration.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Ensure application logs are sent to stdout/stderr.
   - Integrate with monitoring and alerting systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

5. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**
   - Use Deployment strategies that support zero-downtime updates and easy rollback.

6. **Security**
   - Use namespaces for isolation.
   - Apply security contexts and network policies.
   - Run containers as non-root users.

7. **Image Versioning**
   - Avoid using the `:latest` tag; use immutable, versioned images.

8. **Automated CI/CD**
   - Use Jenkins pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment.

9. **Documentation**
   - Maintain clear documentation for deployment, configuration, and operational procedures.

10. **Scalability and High Availability**
    - Design deployments to support scaling and high availability.
